more theatrical than spooky . great for families not hardcore halloween horror seekers .
burgers are way too greasy . not worth the long wait on line .
solid pizza , especially for lunch . not anything that is overly memorable but good .
fun atmosphere , good band set-up . . overall good time in somerville
it's red lantern in seaport . you see one . . . blah blah blah .
average chinese food but people are friendly
